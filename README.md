# Spam-Filter-with-Naive-Bayes

In this project, we want to classify messages as spam or non-spam messages. In order to reach this goal, the computer has to do the following steps for us:
1. Learn how humans classify messages
2. Use that human knowledge to estimate probabilities wether new messages are spam or non-spam
3. Classifies new message based on the probability values - if the probability for spam is greater, then the message should be classified as spam (and vice versa).

For this project we will use the multinominal Naive Bayes algorithm in combination with a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans. The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). <br><br>
